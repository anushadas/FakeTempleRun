# FakeTempleRun
-Description:
This program implements a game similar to "Temple Run" where the user tries to stay alive while on the run and being chased by a monster. Once the program starts, the user is thrown into an infinite menu and a monster is chosen at random from a set of 3 monsters with varying powers("health"). The user can choose to 'Run', 'Fight' or 'Quit'. Everytime the user chooses to run or to fight, a 20 sided dice is rolled and depending on the outcome, points are either added or subtracted from the user's health (initially set to 100). There is a 70% probability that the user will escape, and a 50% probability that the user will win a fight against the monster. In order to win, the user must have a health greater than 0 and kill all the three monsters.
